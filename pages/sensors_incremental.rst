Buyer's description:

    Features : 
    360 p/r (Single-phase 360 pulses /R,Two phase 4 frequency doubling to 1440 pulses) 
    Power source: DC5-24V 
    Shaft: 6*13mm/0.23*0.51" 
    Size: 38*35.5mm/1.49*1.39" 
    Output :AB 2phase output rectangular orthogonal pulse circuit, the output for the NPN open collector output type
    Maximum mechanical speed: 5000 R / min 
    Response frequency: 0-20KHz 
    Cable length: 1.5 meter 
    Notice:AB 2phase output must not be directly connected with VCC, otherwise, will burn the output triode, because different batches, and may not have the terminal
